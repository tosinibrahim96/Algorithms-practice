Question: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.

Discussion:
A palindrome is a string that read the same forwards and backwards and strings can be either even or odd 
number of characters. For a string with even number of characters, then it can only be a palindrome if the number 
of each character is even.I.e no character should be 1,3 etc. For a string with an odd number of characters,
it can only be a valid palindrome if the number of each character in the string is even except 1. If more than one
character has an even number count, then it's not a palindrome. 


Approach 1:
  - Convert the string to lower case
  - Create a map object using the string
  - The keys should be the characters and the value of each key should indicate how many times they apear in the string
  - Another for loop will be created to check the values in the string map to make sure that we have even number for each
  character or only one odd number while the rest are even


Approach 2:
  Ultimately, a map object will be created using the string, but that's not the most important part. This aproach tries to
  count the number of odd characters in the string during the character map process(inside the loop)
  - Convert the string to lower case
  - A variable to track the number of odd characters is initialized and set to 0
  - A loop to build the mapped string object is created,
  - In the loop, check if the current character is an empty string, if yes, continue
  - If not, check if it already exist in the object, if not, add it to the map as the key,
  with the corresponding value 1. Since one is an odd number, the variable tracking the number of odd numbers
  should be incremented, then continue
  - If the character already exist in the object as a key, then increment the value, but before moving on to the next character,
  check if the current value (which represents how many times the current character has appeared) is even, if it is even, then 
  decrement the variable tracking the number of odd characters, if it's odd, increment it
