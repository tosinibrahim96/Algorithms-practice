Question: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.

Discussion:
A palindrome is a string that read the same forwards and backwards and strings can be either even or odd 
number of characters. For a string with even number of characters, then it can only be a palindrome if the number 
of each character is even.I.e no character should be 1,3 etc. For a string with an odd number of characters,
it can only be a valid palindrome if the number of each character in the string is even except 1. If more than one
character has an even number count, then it's not a palindrome. 


Approach 1:
  - Create a map object using the string
  - The keys should be the characters and the value of each key should indicate how many times they apear in the string
  - Another for loop will be created to check the values in the string map to make sure that we have even number for each
  character or only one odd number while the rest are even
