Question: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string.

Discussion:

Approach 1:
  - If string is empty, return null
  - Perform a string replace where empty strings are replaced with %20

Approach 2:
  - Set an initial empty string that will be used as the output
  - Since we'll be looping through the string and we want to stop at the 
  original string length, initialize a tracker that increments on each iteration.
  The initial value = 0.
  - Create a forOf loop for the string. The first thing to check is if the tracker is 
  eqaul to the original string length. If that's true, return the current value of "output(the new empty string previously initialized"
  The second check before concatenation is if the current character is an empty string. If that's true, the the current character variable
  should be set to "%20", then added to the output string. If the current character is not an empty string, then just concatenate straight.
