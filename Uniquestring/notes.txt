Question: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures?


Discussion: 

Approach 1: Create an outer loop that picks each character and an inner loop that compares the character in the outer loop to all 
it to all other characters in the string except itself(If you compare with itself, then the algorithm will be wrong because it will
indicate that the character is not unique in the string).
